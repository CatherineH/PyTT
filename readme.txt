PyTT instructions:

On Windows:

1. Download and install IronPython (ironpython.net)
2. stick ttInterface.dll and UsbDll.dll in the dlls folder of IronPython (by default this is C:\Program Files (x86)\IronPython 2.7\DLLs). If you don't have these drivers, they're available on the QPL subversion repository.
3. add C:\Program Files (x86)\IronPython 2.7\ to your PATH variable (see instructions here: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
4. open the command line, move to the directory where PyTT.py is, and type "ipy PyTT.py"
